# Fire Timer

A simple plugin adding an in-game timer over player-made fires.

### Why?

Fires can last anywhere from 100 to 200 game ticks before dying out. If a player wishes to know when it would be likely that their most recent fire would go out, this plugin may be useful. The plugin will start a timer after a fire is lit. The timer will change color after 100 ticks, indicating that from then on it may go out at any time.
